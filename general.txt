#image classification is a computer vision technique to categorize an image into one of several
predined catergories.

#many technologies are used like:-
python library scikit learn
yolov8
teachable machine(tenserflow, no code)
etc

#input = image

#output = integer, string, vector

#confidence scroes

image classifiers usually provide a  measure of confidence along with their classification
it is a float variable in [0,1]
it represebts how confident the classifier is regarding the classification

#examples

parking spot classifier(empty/non empty)
weather classifier (rain/sunrise/cloudy/shine)
ship classifier(ship/no ship)
spoofing classifier (fake/real)


#image classification metrics
(how to measure the performance of an image classifier?)

confusion matrix
accuracy
precision and recall

#confusion matrix
summarizes performance across all classes
very visual way to evaluate a classifier
ideal confusion matrix is diagonal

#accuracy
interpretability is straightforward if classes are balanced
higher is better
accuracy = (TP + TN)/Total no. of samples

#precision and recall
most adequate metrics if classes are not perfectly balanced or if misclassifications are expensive
recall measures how effectively we can find objects
precision measures how well we perform after we find the objects
higher is better
precision = TP/TP+FP, recall = TP/TP+FN
